    "Hear me, foster father of Bacchos, father and nurturer, best of the Silenoi, honored by all the gods, honored by mortal men in the same triennial feasts.",
    "Pure and prized marshal of the pastoral band, wakeful reveler and companion of the fair-girt nurses, leader of the ivy-crowned Naiads and of the Bacchantes, take all the Satyrs, half-men, half-beast, come howling to the Bacchic lord.",
    "The Bacchantes escort the holy Lenaian procession in sacred litanies revealing torch-lit rites, shouting, thyrsos-loving, finding calm in the revels."
