    "Father Zeus, sublime is the course of the blazing cosmos you drive on, ethereal and lofty the flash of your lightning as you shake the seat of the gods with a god's thunderbolt.",
    "The fire of your lightning emblazons the rain clouds, you bring storms and hurricanes, you bring mighty gales, you hurl roaring thunder, a shower of arrows.",
    "Horrific might and strength sets all aflame, dreadful missile makes hearts pound and hair bristle.",
    "Holy and invincible, it comes with a sudden crash, an endless spiral of noise, omnivorous in its drive, unbreakable and threatening, ineluctable, too, the gale's sharp and smoke-filled shafts swoop down with a flash dreaded by land and sea.",
    "Wild beasts cringe when they hear the noise, faces reflect the brilliance of thunder roaring in the celestial hollows.",
    "You tear the robe that cloaks heaven, you hurl the fiery thunderbolt.",
    "O blessed one..., the anger of the sea waves, the anger of the mountain peaksâ€” we all know your power.",
    "Enjoy this libation and give all things pleasing to the heart: a life of prosperity, queenly health, divine peace that nurtures youths, crowned with honors, a life ever blooming with cheerful thoughts."
