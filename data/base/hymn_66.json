    "Hephaistos, powerful and strong-spirited, unwearying fire, shining in the gleam of flames, a god bringing light to mortals, mighty-handed, eternal artisan, worker, part of the cosmos, blameless element, most sublime, all-eating, all-taming, all-haunting\u2014 ether, sun, stars, moon, pure light: all these parts of Hephaistos are revealed to mortals.",
    "All homes, all cities, all nations are yours.",
    "O mighty giver of many blessings, you dwell in human bodies.",
    "Hear me, lord, as I summon you to this holy libation, that you may always come gentle to joyful deeds, end the savage rage of untiring fire as nature itself burns in our own bodies."
