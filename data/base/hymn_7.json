    "I call forth the sacred light of the heavenly Stars, with devotional prayers I summon the holy daimones.",
    "Heavenly Stars, dear children of black Night, round your thrones you move in circles, you spin in circular ways, O brilliant and fiery begetters of all, you do reveal fate, everyone's fate, you determine the divine path for mortals.",
    "Wandering in midair, you gaze upon the seven luminous orbits.",
    "In heaven and on earth, ever indestructible on your blazing trail, you shine upon the darkness of the cloak night wears.",
    "Coruscating and gleaming, kingly and nocturnal, visit the learned contests of this sacred rite, finish a noble race for works of renown."
