    "You dwell on the road all must take, the road of no return, by the Kokytos, you guide the souls of mortals to the nether gloom.",
    "Hermes, offspring of Dionysos who revels in the dance, and of Aphrodite, the Paphian maiden of the fluttering eyelids, you haunt the sacred house of Persephone as guide throughout the earth of ill-fated souls, the souls you bring to their destined harbor when their time has come; you charm them with your sacred wand, you give them sleep from which you rouse them again.",
    "It is to you indeed that Persephone gave the high office throughout broad Tartaros to lead the way for the everlasting souls of men.",
    "O blessed one, grant a good end for the labors of the initiates."
