    "Upon the holy lord of men and gods I call, heavenly Nomos, who arranges the stars and sets a fair limit between the earth and the waters of the sea; it is his laws that ever preserve nature's balance, obedient and steady.",
    "Journeying on the heavens, he brings the laws from above, with a roar he drives out malicious envy.",
    "Nomos summons a good end to mortal life, he alone steers the course of everything that breathes, ever the steadfast companion of righteous thought.",
    "Primeval and wise, in peace he shares the same house with all who abide by the law, bringing harsh vengeance upon the lawless.",
    "O blessed bringer of prosperity, beloved of all and honored, with kindness of heart send forth memory of you, O mighty one."
