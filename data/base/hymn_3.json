    "I shall sing of Night, mother of gods and men; we call Night Kypris, she gave birth to all.",
    "Hear, O blessed goddess, jet-black and starlit, for you delight in the quiet and slumber-filled serenity.",
    "Cheerful and delightful, lover of the nightlong revel, mother of dreams, you free us from cares, you offer us welcome respite from toil.",
    "Giver of sleep, beloved of all, you gleam in the darkness as you drive your steeds.",
    "Ever incomplete, terrestrial, and then again celestial, you circle around in pursuit of sprightly phantoms, you force light into the nether world, and then again you flee into Hades, for dreadful Necessity governs all things.",
    "But now, O blessed one, beatific, desired by all, I call on you to grant a kind ear to my voice of supplication, and to come, benevolent, to disperse fears that glisten in the night."
