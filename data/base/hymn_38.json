    "Bronze-beating Kouretes, the weapons of Ares are yours.",
    "Dwellers of heaven, of earth and sea, thrice-blessed ones, life-giving breezes, glorious saviors of the world, you dwell in the sacred land of Samothrace, you ward off dangers for mortals roaming the seas, you were first to set up sacred rites for mortals.",
    "O immortal Kouretes, the weapons of Ares are yours.",
    "You rule Okeanos, you rule the sea and the forests, the earth resounds with the pounding of your nimble feet, and with the glories in your gleaming armor.",
    "All wild beasts cringe at your onrush, the din and the shouts rise heavenward, the dust from your feet, as you march briskly, reaches the clouds; every flower is in bloom.",
    "Immortal gods, you nurture, you also destroy when you fret angrily over mankind, you ruin livelihoods and possessions, you ruin men themselves...",
    "the great deep-eddying sea groans, lofty trees are uprooted, they fall upon the earth, the noisy tremor of the leaves echoes in the sky.",
    "Kouretes, Korybantes, mighty lords, masters of Samothrace, true Dioskouroi, ever-blowing breezes, soul-nurturing and airy, you're called celestial twins on Olympos.",
    "Gentle saviors, you bring fair breezes and clear weather, nurturers of seasons and of fruits, breathe upon us, O lords."
