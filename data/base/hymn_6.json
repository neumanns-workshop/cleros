    "Upon two-natured Protogonos, great and ether-tossed, I call; born of the egg, delighting in his golden wings, the begetter of blessed gods and mortal men; he bellows like a bull.",
    "Erikepaios, seed unforgettable, attended by many rites, ineffable, hidden, brilliant scion, forever in whirring motion, you scattered the dark mist, the mist that lay before your eyes.",
    "Flapping your wings, you whirled about throughout this world, you brought pure light.",
    "For this I call you Phanes, yes, I call you Lord Priapos, I call you bright-eyed Antauges.",
    "O blessed one of the many counsels and of the many seeds, come joyfully to the celebrants of this holy rite, of this very intricate rite."
