    "I call upon you, blessed, long-winged, baneful Dream, messenger of things to come, greatest prophet to mortals.",
    "In the quiet of sweet sleep you come silent, you speak to the soul, you rouse men's minds, in their sleep you whisper the will of the gods; silent you come to show the future to silent souls that walk the noble path of devotion to the gods.",
    "Good always wins the race in people's minds, good leads their lives to pleasures anticipated, to a respite from suffering, that god himself may reveal the firmament of the divine lords through vows and sacrifices.",
    "The end to which the pious come is always so sweeter, but to the impious never does a dreamy phantom, a prophet of evil deeds, reveal future need so that they may find the cure from pain to come.",
    "But, O blessed one, I beg you, show me the behests of the gods, in all things bring me close to the path that is straight, do not through weird apparitions show me evil signs."
