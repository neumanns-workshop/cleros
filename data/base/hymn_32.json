    "Reverend Pallas, great Zeus bore you by himself, noble and blessed goddess, brave in the din of war.",
    "Renowned and cave-haunting, spoken of and then ineffable, your domain is on wind-swept hilltops, shaded mountains, dells that charm your heart.",
    "Arms please you, and you strike men's souls with frenzy, O vigorous maiden, O horrid-tempered one, slayer of Gorgo, O blessed mother of the arts, you shun the bed of love, you bring madness to the wicked, you bring prudence to the virtuous, O impetuous one.",
    "Male and female, shrewd begetter of war, she-dragon of the many shapes, frenzy-loving, illustrious, destroyer of the Phlegraian Giants, driver of horses, victorious Tritogeneia, O goddess, you free us from suffering, day and night, ever into the small hours.",
    "Hear my prayer and give me a full measure of peace, of riches, and of health, accompanied by happy seasons, O gray-eyed and inventive queen, to whom many offer their prayers."
