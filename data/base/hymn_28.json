    "Hear me, Hermes, messenger of Zeus, son of Maia, almighty in heart, lord of the deceased, judge of contests, gentle and clever, O Argeiphontes, you are the guide of the flying sandals, a man-loving prophet to mortals.",
    "A vigorous god, you delight in exercise and in deceit.",
    "Interpreter of all you are, and a profiteer who frees us of cares, who holds in his hands the blameless tool of peace.",
    "Lord of Korykos, blessed, helpful, and skilled in words, you assist in work and you are a friend of mortals in need.",
    "You wield the dreaded, the respected weapon of speech.",
    "Hear my prayer and grant a good end to a life of industry, gracious talk, and mindfulness."
