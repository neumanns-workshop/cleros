    "I call upon law-giving Dionysos, who carried the fennel stalk, unforgettable and many-named seed of Eubouleus, I call upon the sacred and holy, upon the ineffable queen Mise, whose twofold nature is male and female.",
    "Redeeming Iacchos, lord, I summon you, whether you delight in Eleusis in your fragrant temple, or with Mother you partake of mystic rites in Phrygia, or you rejoice in Kypros with fair-wreathed Kythereia, or yet you exult in fields wheat-bearing and hallowed along Egypt's river with your divine mother, the revered and black-robed Isis, as your train of nurses tends to your needs.",
    "Lady, kindheartedly come to the noble contests of our initiation."
