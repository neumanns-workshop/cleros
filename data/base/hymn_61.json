    "Nemesis, I call upon you, O goddess, O great queen, your all-seeing eye looks upon the lives of man's many races.",
    "Eternal and revered, you alone rejoice in the just, you change and vary, you shift your word.",
    "All who bear the yoke of mortality fear you, you care about the thoughts of all; the arrogant soul, the reckless one, finds no escape.",
    "You see all, you hear all, you arbitrate all.",
    "O sublime deity, in whom dwells justice for men, come, blessed and pure one, ever helpful to the initiates, grant nobility of mind, put an end to repulsive thoughts, thoughts unholy, fickle and haughty."
