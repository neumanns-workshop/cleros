    "I summon you here through prayer, Tyche, noble ruler, gentle goddess of the roads, for wealth and possessions, I summon you as Artemis the guide, renowned and sprung from the loins of Eubouleus, your wish is irresistible.",
    "Funereal and delusive, you are the theme of men's songs.",
    "In you lies the great variety of men's livelihood: to some you grant a wealth of blessings and possessions, to others you bring evil poverty if you harbor anger against them.",
    "O goddess, I beseech you, come in kindness to my life, grant me happiness, grant me abundant wealth."
