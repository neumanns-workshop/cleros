    "Leaping Kouretes, stepping to the sound of arms, howling mountain men whose feet pound the ground, discordant is the lyre you strike as you pace, light of foot, O renowned marshals, O arm-carrying guards, priests in the train of a mother struck with mountain frenzy.",
    "Kindly visit the people who praise you with words, with joyous heart be gracious to the oxherd."
