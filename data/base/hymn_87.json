    "Hear me, you who steer the path of all mortals and give sacred time to all from whom you are distant.",
    "Your sleep tears the soul free from the body's hold, whenever you undo nature's powerful bonds, bringing the long slumber, the endless one, to the living.",
    "Common to all, you are unjust to some, when you bring swift end to youthful life at its peak.",
    "In you alone is executed the verdict common to all, for to entreaties and to prayers you alone are deaf.",
    "O blessed one, with pious vows, with sacrifices, I beg you, I pray to you, grant me long life, that old age might be a noble prize among men."
