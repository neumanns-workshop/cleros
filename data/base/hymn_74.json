    "I call upon Leukothea, daughter of Kadmos, revered goddess, mighty nurturer of fair-wreathed Dionysos.",
    "Hearken, O goddess, O mistress of the deep-bosomed sea, you delight in waves, you are the greatest savior to mortals, on you depends the unsteady heave of seafaring ships, you alone save men from wretched death at sea, men to whom you swiftly come as welcome savior.",
    "O divine lady, come to the aid of well-benched ships, do kindly save them, bring upon the sea a fair tail wind to the initiates."
