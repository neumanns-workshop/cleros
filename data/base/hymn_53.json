    "I call upon Bacchos, the god we worship annually, chthonic Dionysos, together with the fair-tressed Nymphs he is roused.",
    "In the sacred halls of Persephone he slumbers and puts to sleep pure Bacchic time, every third year.",
    "When he himself stirs up the triennial revel again, he sings a hymn together with his fair-girdled nurses.",
    "As the seasons revolve, he puts to sleep and wakes up the years.",
    "O blessed and fruit-giving Bacchos, O horned spirit of the unripe fruit, come to this most sacred rite with a glow of joy on your face, come teeming with fruit that is holy and perfect."
