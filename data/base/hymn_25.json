    "I call upon Proteus, key-holding master of the sea, first-born, who showed the beginnings of all nature, changing matter into a great variety of forms.",
    "Honored by all, he is wise, and he knows what is now, what was before, and what will be in the future.",
    "He has all at his disposal, transformed far beyond all other immortals who dwell on snowy Olympos and fly through the air and over land and sea, for Physis was the first to place everything in Proteus.",
    "Father, attended by holy providence, visit the mystic initiates, and bring a good end to a life of industry and prosperity."
