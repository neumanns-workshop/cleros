    "I sing of the all-seeing eye of comely and radiant Dike, who is seated upon the sacred throne of lord Zeus.",
    "From heaven you watch the lives of the many human races, you crush the unjust with just retribution, matching things lawless through the truth of equality.",
    "For whenever base opinions prevail in difficult verdicts, because men wish more than is fair, you intervene and rouse justice against her foes.",
    "An enemy of the unjust, you are a gentle goddess to the just.",
    "O goddess, come evenhanded to thoughts that are noble, until that fated day descends on my life."
