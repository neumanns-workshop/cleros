    "Persephone, blessed daughter of great Zeus, sole offspring of Demeter, come and accept this gracious sacrifice.",
    "Much-honored spouse of Plouton, discreet and life-giving, you command the gates of Hades in the bowels of the earth, lovely-tressed Praxidike, pure bloom of Deo, mother of the Erinyes, queen of the nether world, secretly sired by Zeus in clandestine union.",
    "Mother of loud-roaring, many-shaped Eubouleus, radiant and luminous, playmate of the Seasons, revered and almighty, maiden rich in fruits, brilliant and horned, only-beloved of mortals, in spring you take your joy in the meadow of breezes, you show your holy figure in branches teeming with grass-green fruits, in autumn you were made a kidnapper's bride.",
    "You alone are life and death to toiling mortals, O Persephone, you nourish all, always, and kill them, too.",
    "Hearken, O blessed goddess, send forth the fruits of the earth as you blossom in peace, and in gentle-handed health bring a blessed life and a splendid old age to him who is sailing to your realm, O queen, and to mighty Plouton\u2019s kingdom."
