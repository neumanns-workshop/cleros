    "Sleep, you are lord of all, lord of blessed gods and of mortal men, of every living thing the broad earth nurtures, for you alone are master of all, you do visit all, binding their bodies with fetters unforged.",
    "You free us of cares, you offer sweet respite from toil, you grant holy solace to our every sorrow, you save souls by easing them into the thought of Death, since to Death and Oblivion you are a true brother.",
    "But, O blessed one, I beseech you to come sweet-tempered, to be a kindly savior of the initiates, that they may serve the gods."
