    "Hear me and be gracious, O renowned Eumenides, O pure daughters of the great Chthonic Zeus and of lovely Persephone, fair-tressed maiden.",

    "Black-skinned queens, your awesome eyes flash forth flesh-eating darts of light.",
    "Everlasting, repugnant, frightful, sovereign, paralyzing the limbs with madness, hideous, nocturnal, fateful, snake-haired, terrible maidens of the night, it is you I summon to bring me holiness of mind."
