    "Inventive, two-natured, you are master of all: of the sky's ether, of the sea and the land, of the all-begetting winds, which for mortals the goddess of grass and grain nurtures, of all that lies in Tartaros, of all that lies in the roaring sea; you alone govern the course of all these.",
    "O blessed one, come to the initiates with pure thought, banish from them vile impulses."
