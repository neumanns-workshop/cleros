    "Airy Clouds, you nourish fruits and rove the sky, you bring rain as you are driven everywhere by the wind.",
    "Filled with blazing thunder, filled with water, you resound with awesome crashes in the air-filled vault of heaven as you are repelled by the attack of raging winds.",
    "To you I offer my prayers: your dewy cloaks, blown by fair breezes, send fruit-nourishing rains to mother Earth."
