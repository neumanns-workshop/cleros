    "O Nymphs, daughters of great-hearted Okeanos, you dwell inside the earth's damp caves; you are as secret as your paths, O joyous, O chthonic nurses of Bacchos.",
    "You nurture fruits, you haunt meadows, O sprightly and pure travelers of the winding roads, who delight in caves and grottos.",
    "Swift, light-footed, and clothed in dew, you frequent springs, visible and invisible, in ravines and among flowers you shout and frisk with Pan upon mountainsides, gliding down on rocks, you hum with clear voice.",
    "O mountain-haunting maidens of the fields, of gushing springs and of woodlands, sweet-smelling virgins, clothed in white, fresh as the breeze, herds of goats, pastures, splendid fruit, you protect; wild animals love you.",
    "Though you are tender, cold delights you; you feed many, you help them grow, Hamadryad maidens, playful, water-loving.",
    "Spring is your joy, O Nysian and frenzied, O healing ones, in the company of Bacchos and Deo, you bring grace to mortals.",
    "Come to this blessed sacrifice with joyful heart, pour streams of pure rain during the grain-giving seasons."
