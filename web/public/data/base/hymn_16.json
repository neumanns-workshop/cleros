    "Life does not exist without you, growth does not exist without you.",
    "You are in everything, even in the air we venerate, you are queen, and you are mistress.",
    "You toss and turn when the rushing wind tosses and turns.",
    "O blessed goddess, many-named queen of all, may you come with kindness on your joyous face."
