    "Comrade of joyous Dionysos in the revel of the dance, you dwell in the sea's pure, restless depths.",
    "I call upon you, O Palaimon, to come to these sacred rites with kindness in your heart, with joy on your youthful face, come to save your initiates on land and on sea.",
    "When storms come upon ships that ever rove the seas, you alone appear incarnate to save men, to stay the harsh anger over the briny swell."
