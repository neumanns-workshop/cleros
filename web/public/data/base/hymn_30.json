    "I call upon loud-roaring, reveling Dionysos, primeval, two-natured, thrice-born Bacchic lord, savage, ineffable, secretive, two-horned and two-shaped, ivy-covered, bull-faced, warlike, howling, pure.",
    "You take raw flesh in triennial feasts, wrapped in foliage, decked with grape clusters, resourceful Eubouleus, immortal god sired by Zeus when he mated with Persephone in unspeakable union.",
    "Hearken to my voice, O blessed one, you and your fair-girdled nurses, breathe on me in a spirit of perfect kindness."
