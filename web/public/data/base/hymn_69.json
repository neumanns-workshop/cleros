    "Hear, Tisiphone, Allekto, noble Megaira, revered goddesses whose Bacchic cries resound.",
    "Nocturnal and clandestine, you live deep down in the dank cave by the sacred water of the Styx.",
    "Men's unholy designs do incur your anger; rabid and arrogant, you howl over Necessity's dictates, clothed in animal skins, you cause the deep pains of retribution.",
    "O dreaded maidens of the thousand faces, your realm is in Hades, phantoms airy, invisible, swift as thought you are.",
    "The speedy flames of the sun and the moon's glow cannot arouse life's delights without your aid, neither can the excellence of wisdom, as well as the virtue and the joy in bold enterprise and in the sleekness of fair youth.",
    "Upon the races of all men that remain countless, you gaze as the eye of Dike, ever in charge of justice.",
    "O snake-haired and many-shaped goddesses of fate, change my thoughts of life into gentle and soft ones."
