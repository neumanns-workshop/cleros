    "Herakles, stout-hearted and mighty, powerful Titan, strong-handed, indomitable, doer of valiant deeds, shape-shifter, O gentle and endless father of time, ineffable, lord of all, many pray to you, all-conquering and mighty archer and seer, omnivorous begetter of all, peak of all, helper to all, for the sake of men you subdued and tamed savage races.",
    "Peace was your desire; she brings dazzling honors and nurtures youths.",
    "Self-grown, weariless, bravest child of the earth, O illustrious Paion, your primordial scales gleam.",
    "Round your head dawn and dark night cling, and your twelve deeds of valor stretch from east to west.",
    "Immortal, world-wise, boundless and irrepressible, come, O blessed one, come, O blessed one, bringing all charms against disease, with club in hand drive evil bane away, with your poisonous darts do ward off cruel death."
