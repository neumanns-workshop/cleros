    "Seasons, daughters of Themis, daughters of Lord Zeus, Eunomia and Dike and thrice-blessed Eirene, pure spirits of spring, of blossoming meadows, you are found in every color, in all scents wafted by the breezes.",
    "Ever-blooming, revolving, and sweet-faced, O Seasons, you cloak yourselves with the dew of luxuriant flowers.",
    "At play you are companions of holy Persephone, when the Fates and the Graces in circling dances come forth to the light, pleasing Zeus and their mother, giver of fruits.",
    "Come to the new initiates and their holy and reverent rites, bring perfect seasons for the growth of goodly fruit."
