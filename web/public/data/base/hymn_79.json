    "I call upon pure Themis, daughter of noble Sky and Earth, Themis the young, the lovely-faced maiden, the first to show mortals the holy oracle as prophetess of the gods in her Delphic hideaway on Pythian ground where Python was king.",
    "You taught lord Phoibos the art of giving laws.",
    "Amid reverence and honor you shine in the night, for you were first to teach men holy worship, howling to Bacchos in nights of revelry; from you come the honors of the gods, the honors of the holy mysteries.",
    "O blessed maiden, come in a joyous, in a kindly spirit to your very sacred, to your mystical rites."
