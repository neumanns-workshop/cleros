    "Deo, divine mother of all, goddess of many names, revered Demeter, nurturer of youths, giver of prosperity and wealth, you nourish the ears of corn, O giver of all, you delight in peace and in toilsome labor.",
    "Present at sowing, heaping, and threshing, O spirit of the unripe fruit, you dwell in the sacred valley of Eleusis.",
    "Charming and lovely, you give sustenance to all mortals; you were the first to yoke the ploughing ox, the first to send up from below a rich, a lovely harvest for mortals.",
    "You are growth and blooming, O illustrious companion of Bromios, torch-bearing and pure, you delight in the summer's yield.",
    "From beneath the earth you appear, gentle to all, O holy and youth-nurturing lover of children and of fair offspring.",
    "You yoke your chariot to bridled dragons, round your throne you whirl and howl in ecstasy.",
    "You are an only daughter, but you have many children and many powers over mortals; the variety of flowers reflect your myriad faces and your sacred blossoms.",
    "Come, O blessed and pure one, come with the fruits of summer, bring peace, bring the welcome rule of law, bring riches, too, and prosperity, and bring health that governs all."
