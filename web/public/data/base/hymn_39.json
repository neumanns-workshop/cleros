    "I call upon the greatest king of eternal earth, blessed Korybas, the warlike, the one of the forbidding countenance, the nocturnal Koures who saves us from dreadful fear.",
    "Korybas, you save us from fantasies as you wander in deserted places.",
    "Many are the shapes, O lord, of your twofold divinity; your blood is tainted with the murder of twin brothers.",
    "You follow Deo's thinking, you changed your holy form into the shape of a savage, dark dragon.",
    "O blessed one, hear our voices, banish harsh anger, free from fantasies souls stunned by compulsions."
