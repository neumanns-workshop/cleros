    "In war you are the judge of deeds deserving prizes; sweet is the boast you grant after the onslaught.",
    "Nike, mistress of all, on your good name depends noble glory, glory that comes from the strife and teems with festivities.",
    "O blessed and beloved one, come with joy in your eyes, come for works of renown, bring me noble glory."
