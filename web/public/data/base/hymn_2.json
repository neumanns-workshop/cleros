    "Hear me, O revered goddess, O many-named divinity, O sight sweet to women in labor, you offer them aid in travail.",
    "You save women, and you alone love children, O kindly goddess of swift birth, ever helpful to young women, O Prothyraia.",
    "You hold the keys, you are accessible to all, O mistress, gracious and fond of nurture, you have power in every house, and you delight in festivities.",
    "You loosen girdles, and though invisible you are seen in every deed, you share pain, you rejoice in every birth, O Eileithyia, you free from pain those in terrible distress.",
    "Upon you alone pregnant women call, O comforter of souls, and in you alone there is relief from pains of labor.",
    "Artemis, Eileithyia, reverend Prothyraia, hear, O blessed one, help me and grant offspring; save me, savior of all, for it is in your nature to do so."
