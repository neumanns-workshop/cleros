    "Divine are your honors, O mother of the gods and nurturer of all.",
    "Yoke your swift chariot drawn by bull-slaying lions, and join our prayers, O mighty goddess.",
    "You bring things to pass, O many-named and revered one, you are queen of the sky; in the cosmos yours is the throne, the throne in the middle, because the earth is yours, and you give gentle nourishment to mortals.",
    "Of you were born gods and men, you hold sway over the rivers and over all the sea.",
    "Hestia is one of your names, they call you giver of prosperity, because you bestow on men all manner of blessings.",
    "Come to this rite, queen whom the drum delights, all-taming savior of Phrygia, consort of Kronos, honored child of Sky, frenzy-loving nurturer of life, joyously and graciously visit our deeds of piety."
