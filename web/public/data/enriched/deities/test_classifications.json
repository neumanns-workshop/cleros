    "description": "Mousaios is not a standard Olympian, Chthonic, Titan, or well-defined deity within the Greek pantheon. He appears specifically within the Orphic tradition as a figure associated with initiation into mystical rites and is considered the first teacher of Orphic theology and the founder of the Orphic mysteries. He is a primordial figure *within the Orphic cosmology*, but not a primordial deity in the same sense as the Titans. He is more accurately described as a divine ancestor or a semi-divine founder of a religious tradition.",

This context firmly places him within the Olympian pantheon, the primary gods residing on Mount Olympus. While possessing connections to broader cosmic forces, his initial presentation is as a king amongst other established Olympian figures.",

    "description": "In this Orphic Hymn, 'Earth' is invoked alongside other deities strongly associated with the earth, underworld, and fertility (Persephone, Demeter, Poseidon). While not *in* the underworld, her presence signifies the primordial source and grounding force for all things, linking her to chthonic powers. She is the foundation upon which the Olympian realm exists, and her invocation alongside underworld figures solidifies this classification.",
